# tidymodels-examples

This repository hosts my personal collection of `tidymodels` implementations for various routines in model fitting and evaluation.

## Getting Started

All examples are stored in each different branches. For example, if you want to get the example for random forest classification model, you can look into `classification-rand_forest` branch.

### How to Get the Example

You can download the examples either from the repository page or terminal:

* From repository page:

1. Switch the branch (the **"Branch:"** dropdown menu) into your desired examples; e.g., `classification-rand_forest`
2. Click the **"Clone or Download"** button

* From terminal:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone -b classification-rand_forest --single_branch bagasbgy/tidymodels-examples
```
