# tidymodels-examples

This repository hosts my personal collection of `tidymodels` implementations for various routines in model fitting, evaluation, and automation.

**This repository is still in early development stage**. If you're looking for some example, you can still check-out some scripts in `R/fit` folder; which not only represent a distraction free codes, but also an example of in-production implementation.

## Further Development

* `.R` script for making prediction into new data
* `.Rmd` files for explaining each script
* `.Rmd` files for reporting templates
* `.R` script for automated-fitting with multiple models and recipes
* `.R` script for ensemble learning; it would be heavily inspired by [Alex Hayes' post](https://alexpghayes.com/blog/implementing-the-super-learner-with-tidymodels/)
* Rearrange the files into various machine learning problems (e.g., regression, classification, and time-series)
