# tidymodels-examples

This repository hosts my personal collection of `tidymodels`
implementations for various routines in model fitting and evaluation.

## Getting Started

All examples are stored in each different branches. For example, if you
want to get the example for random forest classification model, you can
look into `classification-rand_forest` branch.

### How to Get the Example

You can download the examples either from the repository page or
terminal:

  - From repository page:

<!-- end list -->

1.  Switch the branch (the **“Branch:”** dropdown menu) into your
    desired examples; e.g., `classification-rand_forest`
2.  Click the **“Clone or Download”** button

<!-- end list -->

  - From
terminal:

<!-- end list -->

``` bash
git clone -b classification-rand_forest --single_branch bagasbgy/tidymodels-examples
```
